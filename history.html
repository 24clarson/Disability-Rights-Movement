    <h3>History</h3>
    <div class="text-content">
      <p class="main-text">The concept of "Disability" can be interpreted in many ways, but most can be classified as belonging to one of three groups.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><p class="main-text">
          The moral model, often associated with religion, which sees disability as a trial, or even punishment. Ideally, this model pities and tries to help those with disabilities.
        </p></li>
        <li><p class="main-text">
          The medical model, which considers disability a disease and a result of bad luck and/or genetics. The medical model would seek to treat and eliminate disabilities.
        </p></li>
        <li><p class="main-text">
          The social model, which views disability as a problem with society rather than an individual. For example, needing a wheelchair is not disabling unless buildings do not have ramps/elevators.
        </p></li>
      </ol>
      <p class="main-text">Over time, society's view of disability has shifted through all three models. One of the goals of the Disability Rights Movement was to shift from the medical model to the social model. Now, society is a lot more willing to accomodate specific needs, with ramps, special education, etc.</p>

      <p class="main-text">Notable protests and victories of the Disabilities Rights Movement:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p class="main-text">
          The "Capitol Crawl" (March 12, 1990), where dozens of protesters climbed the capitol steps without the aid of wheelchairs, crutches, etc. This contributed to the passing of the Americans with Disabilities Act later that year.
        </p></li>
        <li><p class="main-text">
          Ed Roberts was not allowed to attend UC Berkeley in 1962, but challenged the admissions office and won.
