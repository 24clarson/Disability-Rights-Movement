    <h3>History</h3>
    <div class="text-content">
      <p class="main-text">The concept of "Disability" can be interpreted in many ways, but most can be classified as belonging to one of three groups.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><p class="main-text">
          The moral model, often associated with religion, which sees disability as a trial, or even punishment. Ideally, this model pities and tries to help those with disabilities.
        </p></li>
        <li><p class="main-text">
          The medical model, which considers disability a disease and a result of bad luck and/or genetics. The medical model would seek to treat and eliminate disabilities.
        </p></li>
        <li><p class="main-text">
          The social model, which view disability as a problem with society rather than an individual. For example, using a wheelchair is not disabling unless buildings do not have ramps/elevators.
        </p></li>
      </ol>
      <p class="main-text">Over time, society's view of disability has shifted through all three models. One of the goals of the Disability Rights Movement was to shift from the medical model to the social model. Now, society is a lot more willing to accomodate specific needs, with ramps, special education, etc.</p>
