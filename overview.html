        <p class="main-text">The goals of the Disability Rights Movement were to secure support, equal opportunities, and independence for those with disabilities. Through many protests, such as the Capitol Crawl, the movement led to the Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990, which prevents discrimination and guarantees accomodations. The movement also succeeded in changing for the better how people view disabilities, resulting in a much more accepting society today.</p>

      <p class="main-text">Throughout history, people with disabilities have been discriminated against and oppressed. Those using wheelchairs struggled to get around, people with mental disabilities were institutionalized and abused, etc. According to Gunnar Dybwad, a disability rights activist, "[Prejudice] is used by the strong man who feels threatened... by those who, to him, are representing a human frailty and deficiency." This shows how fear of weakness can lead to prejudice and discrimination, making life even harder for people already struggling with a disability. In the second half of the 20th century, Americans with disablitilies proved that they are anything but weak by protesting for their rights and fighting for protective laws.</p>
